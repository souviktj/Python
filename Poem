Beneath the sky so vast and blue,  
A world unfolds, both old and new.  
Mountains rise with timeless grace,  
Guardians of Earth's sacred space.  

Whispering winds in ancient trees,  
Tell secrets carried by the breeze.  
Leaves that dance in sunlight's glow,  
A rhythmic pulse, a steady flow.  

Oceans shimmer, deep and wide,  
A liquid mirror, Earth's great pride.  
Waves that crash and softly sing,  
Harbingers of life's beginning.  

Fields of flowers, colors bright,  
A painter's dream, a sheer delight.  
Petals soft, with scents divine,  
Each a spark of life's design.  

In twilight's hush, as stars appear,  
The cosmos whispers, drawing near.  
Nature's canvas, vast and bold,  
A story infinite, untold.  

The chorus of a distant stream,  
A lullaby, a fleeting dream.  
Nature's symphony, raw and pure,  
A timeless gift that will endure.  

Let us marvel, let us care,  
For Earth's great wonders, rich and rare.  
To tread with love, to stand in awe,  
Nature's beauty, nature's law.  ''')
